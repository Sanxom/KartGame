# KartGame
A split-screen kart racing game with a decent backend design.  At the moment, requires a keyboard for one player, and a controller for another player.  The game begins when both players press "W" and Face-button south ("X" on a PS5 controller, for example), respectively.  No way to exit other than Alt+F4 because this is just an example that can be expanded upon.
